# Callbacks endpoint

Last update: May 13, 2026
- Topics:
- [Tags](#)

CREATED FOR:

- Developer

A callback is a message that the Reactor API sends to a specific URL (usually one that is hosted by your organization).

Callbacks are intended to be used in conjunction with [audit events](/en/docs/experience-platform/tags/api/endpoints/audit-events) to track activities in the Reactor API. Each time an audit event of a certain type is generated, a callback can send a matching message to the specified URL.

The service behind the URL specified in the callback must respond with HTTP status code 200 (OK) or 201 (Created). If the service does not respond with either of these status codes, the message delivery is retried at the following intervals:

- 1 minute
- 5 minutes
- 30 minutes
- 1 hour
- 12 hours
- 1 day
- 3 days

NOTE
Retry intervals are relative to the previous interval. For example, if the retry at one minute fails, the next attempt is scheduled for five minutes after the one-minute attempt failed (six minutes after the message was generated).
If all delivery attempts are unsuccessful, the message is discarded.

A callback belongs to exactly one [property](/en/docs/experience-platform/tags/api/endpoints/properties). A property can have many callbacks.

## Getting started

The endpoint used in this guide is part of the [Reactor API](https://www.adobe.io/experience-platform-apis/references/reactor/). Before continuing, please review the [getting started guide](/en/docs/experience-platform/tags/api/getting-started) for important information regarding how to authenticate to the API.

## List callbacks list

You can list all callbacks under a property by making a GET request.

**API format**

```
GET  /properties/{PROPERTY_ID}/callbacks
```

Parameter
Description
{PROPERTY_ID}
The
id
of the property whose callbacks you want to list.
NOTE
Using query parameters, listed callbacks can be filtered based on the following attributes:
- created_at
- updated_at

filtering responses
**Request**

```
curl -X GET \
  https://reactor.adobe.io/properties/PR66a3356c73fc4aabb67ee22caae53d70/callbacks \
