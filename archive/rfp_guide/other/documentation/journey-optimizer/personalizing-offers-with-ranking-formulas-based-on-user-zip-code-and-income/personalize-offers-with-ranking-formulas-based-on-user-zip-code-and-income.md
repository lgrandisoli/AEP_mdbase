This use case demonstrates how to deliver personalized financial offers by leveraging user attributes like ZIP code and annual income within Adobe Journey Optimizer. By using ranking formulas, offers are intelligently scored and prioritized based on location-specific promotions and income-based eligibility. For example, high-yield CDs can be promoted to users in affluent ZIP codes, while diversified investment options are shown to emerging investors. Ranking formulas ensures that each user receives offers that are both relevant and financially appropriate. Ranking criteria are defined using profile attributes, contextual signals, and optional AI models to further enhance decision precision. Offers are delivered in real-time through web or email channels, driving higher engagement and conversion. This approach combines business logic with data-driven personalization to elevate the user experience and marketing impact.
